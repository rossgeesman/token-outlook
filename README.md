## Distributed Ledger Technologies
The enormous growth, both investment and general interest into distributed ledger technologies has been immense over the past several years. While the technology is surely promising, outside of serving as a speculative vehicle, there is still much disagreement about what the actual applications of this technology should be. Some believe it to be world changing technology with wide reaching impact, from industry to politics while others see these assets as a sort of Ponzi scheme. As an interested observer of this technology who often struggles with these questions, I'm writing this in an attempt at developing a slightly more deep understanding of its implications.

## My Motivations
I'm already convinced that distributed ledger technology will see continued adoption. However, I'm not sure how large a role it will play in the future economy, or how much adoption will affect the price, I think that it's wise to invest a small portion of one's investments in these assets when appropriate. While the over 700 actively traded cryptocurrencies in existence have almost all exploded in value over the past several years, I think it's safe to say that future adoption and price growth won't equally distributed going forwards. Some will see massive growth in usage and others will be forgotten as the rubber meets the road and real use cases begin to emerge. Since I've decided to invest, it makes sense to at least attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff so I can make smarter investments or at least minimize exposure to technology that is unlikely to be adopted.

Additionally, as someone who works with a variety of technologies day to day as a software developer, I'm interested in getting a better understanding of what role distributed ledger technologies might play in my industry.
