This is a work in progress :) 

## Distributed Ledger Technologies
The enormous growth, both investment and general interest into distributed ledger technologies (DLT) has been immense over the past several years. While the technology is surely promising, outside of serving as a speculative vehicle, there is still much disagreement about what the actual applications of this technology should be. Some believe it to be world-changing technology with wide reaching impact, from industry to politics while others see these assets as a Ponzi scheme. As an interested observer of this technology who often struggles with these questions, I'm writing this in an attempt at developing a deeper understanding of its implications and potential applications.

## My Motivations
While the over 700 actively traded cryptocurrencies in existence have almost all exploded in value over the past several years, this growth is caused by speculation over future utility rather than actual adoption. As someone who works with a variety of technologies day-to-day as a software developer, I'm interested in getting a better understanding of what role DLT might play in the future. 

My main questions are: 

1. What are the main benefits of incorporating DLT into a business, either an existing enterprise, or a new company? 
2. Given these benefits, what types of businesses are likely to see successful adoption?
3. Given the conclusions of questions 1 & 2, which of the current crop of distributed ledger projects are likely to be successful?

### Benefits of DLT


#### Fault Tolerance

#### Availability

#### Auditability

#### Anonymity

#### Security

#### Openness 

#### Economical
